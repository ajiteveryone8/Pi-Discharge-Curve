# Project: C# Windows Application for Raspberry Pi Data Monitoring

This desktop application retrieves real-time data from a Flask server running on a Raspberry Pi, processes the JSON response, and displays the data in a dynamic graph using the ZGraph library.

## Technologies Used
- **C#** (Windows Application)
- **Flask** (Server running on Raspberry Pi)
- **Web Requests** (to fetch JSON data)
- **ZGraph** (Third-party library for graph visualization)

## Features
- **Live Data Graph**: Displays live updates of data in a running graph.
- **Historical Data**: Click on the graph to view past data points.
- **Data Metrics**:
  - Raspberry Pi CPU Temperature
  - Current Consumption
  - Voltage

## Usage
The application connects to the Flask server hosted on a Raspberry Pi and displays real-time monitoring of hardware statistics, including temperature, current, and voltage, in a graphical format.
